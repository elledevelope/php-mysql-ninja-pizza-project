## Technologies Used

- **[PHP](https://www.php.net/)**  which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a widely-used server-side scripting language. It is particularly suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. PHP enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages by allowing developers to embed code directly within the HTML source code.

- **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that plays a crucial role in storing and managing data for web applications. It uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to perform various operations such as data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion. MySQL is often integrated with PHP to create powerful and data-driven web applications.

- **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)** is a cross-platform software stack that facilitates the development and testing of web applications on a local machine. The name XAMPP is an acronym that represents its components: Apache (web server), MariaDB (or MySQL, which serves as the database), PHP, and Perl. XAMPP provides a convenient and portable environment for developers to simulate a production server locally, making it easier to develop and test PHP and MySQL applications.

- **[Materialize CSS Library](https://materializecss.com/)** is a responsive front-end framework based on Material Design. It offers a collection of CSS and JavaScript components that make it easy to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. Materialize CSS simplifies the process of building modern and mobile-friendly web applications by providing a consistent and visually appealing design language.


## Getting Started

_Note: Use the [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gksOX3Kd9KPo-O68ncT05o) as a guide to understanding the code and concepts. Each video corresponds to a specific section of the tutorial series._

1. Prerequisites: 
Ensure you have PHP and MySQL installed on your development machine. You can follow the instructions in the tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B-CnezwEeo&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gksOX3Kd9KPo-O68ncT05o&index=2) to set up your environment.

2. Clone this repository (branch: #33---Finishing-Touches) to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/elledevelope/project_ninja_pizza_php/
```

3. Navigate to the Project Directory:

``` bash
 cd project_ninja_pizza_php
```
4. Start XAMPP and open your localhost

## What I learned
This PHP and MySQL tutorial, crafted by [@iamshaunjp](@https://github.com/iamshaunjp), has been my gateway to a comprehensive learning experience. Throughout the course, I immersed myself in the basics of PHP, starting from the ground up and applying my newfound knowledge to construct a "Ninja Pizza" website. The tutorial thoughtfully explores the seamless integration of a MySQL database, empowering me to efficiently store and retrieve data using SQL. Key concepts such as handling forms (POST, GET, etc.), validating data, and redirecting users were thoroughly covered, providing me with a well-rounded understanding of PHP and MySQL. üçïüìäüí°
